We all know you should take a sick day
00:01
or a mental health day
00:03
or even a personal day.
00:04
But a financial day is just as important.
00:07
[Your Money and Your Mind with Wendy De La Rosa]
00:11
You deserve to take time to get your life in order
00:14
when you aren't on edge and under pressure.
00:16
Employers, if you're watching this: you should also think about
00:20
giving your employees a financial health day.
00:22
Throughout this series,
00:23
I've shared ways that you can change your environment
00:26
so you can spend less and save more.
00:28
But the secret ingredient for each tip has been time:
00:31
calling your credit card company to change your interest rate takes time;
00:35
deleting an app off your phone takes time.
00:37
And if you haven't had time to put these changes into action,
00:41
this is your chance.
00:42
Mark a day on your calendar right now
00:45
to devote to reorganizing your finances.
00:47
Really commit to this day
00:49
and make that day as productive as possible.
00:52
But here are the big headlines that are the most important to cover,
00:55
both from earlier episodes and beyond.
00:58
So first I want you to focus on your fixed expenses.
01:01
Take the day to evaluate your bills.
01:03
Can you truly afford your housing payment?
01:06
Is it time to start looking for a cheaper place?
01:08
Do you need to switch to a low-cost cell phone provider?
01:11
Do you need to trade in your car for something else?
01:14
This is the day where I really want you to think about
01:16
those large fixed expenses
01:18
and make that one-time change.
01:20
Number two: sign up for the boring-but-necessary stuff.
01:24
Do you have life insurance?
01:25
No? Sign up now.
01:26
Are you enrolled in your company's 401(k)?
01:29
No? Sign up now.
01:30
Are you contributing enough to that 401(k)?
01:32
No? Edit your contribution rate right now.
01:35
Number three: if you haven't already,
01:37
talk to your significant other about money.
01:39
Get on the same page; it matters.
01:42
Visit the link below for a list of questions
01:44
to help get you started.
01:46
Number four: create a singular savings goal.
01:49
You can start by setting up an automatic plan
01:51
so that a portion of every paycheck
01:53
goes directly into your savings account.
01:55
Number five: start paying off your debt every week,
01:58
not just every month.
02:00
Maybe it's your credit card debt
02:01
or your mortgage debt or whatever you have,
02:03
you'll end up reducing more of your debt over the course of a year
02:07
if you pay that debt more often.
02:09
Number six: renegotiate your credit card interest rate
02:12
and change your payment due date.
02:14
Get on the phone, call your credit card company
02:17
and make your credit card company work for you.
02:19
Number seven: use technology to your advantage.
02:22
Redesign your online environment
02:24
by unsubscribing from all your shopping newsletters
02:28
and install an ad blocker.
02:29
You can't spend on what you can't see.
02:32
Number eight: delete those distracting delivery apps.
02:35
Number nine:
02:37
now, my tips are not all about cutting back spending.
02:39
I want you to spend on things that increase your happiness.
02:43
So focus on experiences, on spending time with others
02:46
and on expenditures that help save you time,
02:49
like hiring someone to clean your house
02:51
or mow your lawn.
02:53
That will save you time and boost your happiness.
02:56
Number 10: last but certainly not least,
02:59
schedule another financial health day
03:01
for a few weeks later.
03:02
Chances are, you'll need to revisit some of the things
03:05
you started today.
03:06
I know all of this may seem tedious or boring,
03:08
but it's better to make these vital changes
03:11
when you have the time to think about them,
03:13
and not under the stressful conditions
03:15
when we usually make these very important decisions.
03:18
Not every day can be a spa day,
03:20
but I think a financial day
03:22
will leave you feeling soothed and pampered.
